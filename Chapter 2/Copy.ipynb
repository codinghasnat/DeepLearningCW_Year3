        "This tutorial addresses the basic concepts regarding Convolutional Neural Networks and their implementation using the Keras framework.\n",
        "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of feed-forward artificial neural architecture. They are applied to analyse visual 2D imagery, meaning that we can feed images directly into a CNN without the need to flatten them into a 1D vector as done in the previous tutorial.\n",
        "CNNs have revolutionised the field of computer vision in the last decade. In 2012 Alex Krizhevsky introduced the AlexNet architecture to win the ImageNet Challenge (one of the most important competitions on image classification within the Computer Vision community), by reducing the top-5 error more than 10 percentage points, which was an incredible improvement at that time. As of now, CNNs are used not only on image classification but in many other computer vision tasks.\n",

        "The basic pipeline of common CNNs consists of an image as input and a stack of convolutional layers that extract a feature representation from the input image. The final shape of the image representation is conditioned on the type of problem/task that the architecture is facing. For instance, the output of the last layer in a classification problem is a probability vector. Each dimension of the probability vector represents how likely is that the input image belongs to a specific class. However, the architecture design is up to us, and therefore, we could code a network that outputs a single value for regression problems, or that generates a new image map for semantic segmentation. Now, let's dig in a bit into CNN and introduce some layers that are widely used. "

Convolutional layers are specifically designed to extract features from images or even extract features from previously extracted features. As shown in the following illustration, 2D convolutions apply the same filter to the full image. And therefore, due to its nature, 2D convolutional filters exploit the local information presented in images, making them a powerful tool for image analysis. \n",

We will address here how 2D convolutions work since full understanding is needed to comprehend how any CNN operates. The following images and some explanations can be further explored on the original [Irhum Shafkat's blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/intuitively-understanding-convolutions-for-deep-learning-1f6f42faee1) or in the [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) book.

The numbers on the kernels are the so-called weights, and the weights on the kernels change as we train the network. Hence, network training aims to optimise the network's parameters (update the kernel weights) such that the cost function is minimised. \n",

The results of this elementwise multiplication are added to obtain the output value of the operation.

This generated feature map can go through another 2D convolutional layer and create more powerful features. \n",

Thus, the new feature values are the weighted sum of all the elements in the sliding window after the elementwise multiplication between input and kernel.  The bigger the size of the kernel is, the more feature elements contribute to the final output value. In contrast to fully connected layers, where a new feature value is a weighted sum over **all** input values, as mentioned, 2D convolutions compute features based on local areas. In other words, instead of looking at every input component, they consider only features coming from close locations. \n",

Hence, instead of jumping one pixel apart, we can define the number of skipped elements before computing the weighting sum between the kernel's weights and input features. A stride of 1 means that features will be extracted from all windows a pixel apart, so basically, every single window is computed. A stride of 2 means that we are selecting windows 2 pixels apart, skipping every other window in the process. Strides reduce the number of computations and consequently the size of the output map. In practice, as we go deeper into the CNN, the spatial size of the feature map gets smaller while the number of channels increases.

However, when dealing with RGB images or feature maps, the input is no longer a single-channel map but, instead, they can have multiple channels. In the case of an RGB image, for each 2D convolution, we will need to define 3 kernels to interact with each of the image's channel colours. This group of kernels is called a filter. Thus, a filter is a collection of kernels that produces a single output.\n",

        "As a regular practice when defining Deep Learning models, we increase the number of filters in each convolutional layer as we go deeper into the model. Due to the element-wise multiplication, the number of kernels on each filter must be the same that the number of channels in the input feature map. Keras already deals with the number of kernels inside each filter. Keras keeps track of the input size in each convolutional layer unlike other frameworks (Pytorch or TensorFlow). Hence, in Keras, we must only decide the number of filters (output channels) in each layer.\n",

        "As seen in previous tutorials, after a `Dense` layer we usually can find an activation function. We introduce here how to use them after `Conv2D` layers. Those activation functions are a set of operators that maps the feature values to a new set of values, the mapping depends on the function at hand. The main reason for using activation functions is that they add non-linearities to the network, giving more expressive power to the network, which will be able to reproduce more complex functions. \n",

        "*  **Sigmoid Function** sets the output in the range (0, 1). The sigmoid function is widely used in binary classification problems since its output can be taken as a probability value. `keras.activations.sigmoid(x)`:\n",
        "\n",
        ">![](https://i.ibb.co/Ph8dsTv/sigmoid.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "*  **Tanh Function** is a logistic function as sigmoid, but the range of the tanh function is (-1, 1). Contrary to sigmoid function, where the values close to 0 are set around 0.5, in the tanh function they will be still mapped around the 0 value. `keras.activations.tanh(x)`:\n",

        ">![](https://i.ibb.co/68g7LpL/tanh.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "*  **ReLU Function** is the most common activation function you can find in any current CNN as in general works better than the rest. The range of this function is in \\[0, inf). It sets all negative values to 0 and hence is computationally easy to implement. As a drawback, during training some neurons *die*, meaning that the output is 0 for all available data points and no gradient is propagated there. `keras.activations.relu(x, alpha=0.0, max_value=None, threshold=0.0)`:\n",

        "\n",
        "*  **LeakyReLU Function** is a modified version of the ReLU activation above, which attempts to solve the problem of dying neurons that ReLU has. While ReLU does not backpropagate negative values, Leaky ReLU smooths those values without setting them to 0. That allows the gradients to backpropagate through the network even for negative values. `keras.layers.LeakyReLU(alpha=0.3)`:\n",

This function sets all of the output elements to the range (0, 1). However, the softmax function does not take independently the input values to map it into its probability value. Softmax Function takes an un-normalized vector, $s$, and normalizes it into a probability distribution, $p$, following the softmax expression. As the output is a probability, the output elements add up to 1. `keras.activations.softmax(x, axis=-1)`. Thus, the output value $p_i$ is computed as:\n",

        "It is a common practice to insert a pooling layer between convolutional layers in CNNs. In a standard CNN architecture, we set the feature sizes to become smaller progressively to reduce the computation in the networks, and to merge the information from different spatial locations. To reduce the feature map sizes, we can either use bigger stride size in the convolutional layers or we can use pooling layers. Pooling layers perform a spatial sliding window and apply an operation to reduce the spatial size. Those operations vary depending on the architecture, being the max, mean and min pooling the most typical ones. Here, we will explain the max pooling, although all the others work similarly. Max pooling keeps only the max value in a neighbourhood, where the neighbourhood is defined by the size of the kernel. Let's visualise it, the next example shows the result of a Max Pooling layer with a 2x2 kernel and a stride of 2.\n",
